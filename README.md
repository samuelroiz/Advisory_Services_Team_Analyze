# Advisory_Services_Team_Analyze

# Predict_Credit_Risk
<p>
Created a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for the Advisory Services Team of a financial consultancy. Clients are interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. The company asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and determines whether they can be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The organization gave raw data to process it to fit the machine learning models. Using unsupervised learning and several clustering algorithms to explore the cryptocurrencies can be grouped with other similar cryptocurrencies. Create data visualization to share the findings with the investment bank and communicate with the non-data science audience.
